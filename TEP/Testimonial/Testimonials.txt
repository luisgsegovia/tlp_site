Anish: TEP program gives lot of flexibility of learning here at Citi. Everyone here is really helpful and give you opportunities to develop and grow. My manager also volunteered me to contribute to rebranding of Citi's auction site and also had been working on the Angular integration with the Drupal Content Management System. There is good exposure to senior leadership and strong bonding with TEP family. 


Kate Callahan: The onboarding process means you have a built-in network of people who are going through the exact same
thing you are. It's incredibly helpful to have a group of people who understand exactly what you're going
through to complain about things and compare notes.

I also love the connections I've made with my team. It took a while to get to know everyone, but
most were very friendly, and open to answering questions as I got ramped up.
A few months in, the whole team surprised me with birthday cake after a meeting. I definitely feel the love.

Also, the drawers on the desks are very spacious, and the "no food" rule is totally unenforced.
I've had a five pound bag of candy in there for the past month for casual snacking purposes. It's great.
